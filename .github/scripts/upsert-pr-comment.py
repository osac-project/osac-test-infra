"""Insert or replace a named, HTML-comment-delimited section within a
sticky PR comment body.

Lets ai-diagnostic-e2e.yml maintain one persistent comment per PR (one
section per E2E suite) instead of posting a new comment on every failure.
Pure text transform -- the calling workflow step handles all GitHub API
calls (finding the existing comment, POSTing/PATCHing the result).

SECTION_KEY is the triggering workflow's own name and is nominally
re-nameable by a PR that edits its own caller workflow's `name:` field --
but it's regex-escaped before use here and only ever affects that PR's own
single sticky comment, so at worst a renamed section label is cosmetically
confusing within that one PR, never a cross-PR or injection issue.
