        history gets (re)classified too, not just new rows. Also re-checks
        rows already classified "infra" or "test" -- a TEST_STEPS change
        (e.g. covering a new e2e flavor's step names) only affects new rows
        unless existing ones are re-walked here, same rationale as
        _recategorize_jobs_if_needed for WORKFLOW_CATEGORIES. Safe to
        re-run every startup: no-op once every failed row already matches
        what _classify_failure_reason would assign today.

        The live-jobs list _classify_failure_reason optionally uses to
        detect a gate-only failure (see _is_gate_only_failure) isn't
        available here -- only the flattened text is stored, not each
        job's raw conclusion. Approximated instead from the stored
        "job -> step" entries themselves: if every entry's job name is a
        gate job (rows recorded before the ingestion-time gate filter
        existed still have these), it's a gate-only failure by the same
        definition. Rows recorded after that filter existed have an empty
        failed_step for a true gate-only failure (the entries were already
        dropped before storage) -- for those, an empty failed_step is
        genuinely ambiguous from text alone (it could equally mean "no
        data at all", which is legitimately "infra"), so a row already
        classified "gate" is left as-is rather than re-derived here.
        Without that, every exporter restart would silently flip an
        already-correct "gate" row back to "infra" the moment its
        failed_step happens to be empty -- confirmed live, e.g. osac run
        #32265159432, reclassified back and forth across restarts before
        this guard existed.

        """PR merge timing/retest stats, filtered by when the PR was
        *merged* (not opened) -- "in the past week" means the merge event
        fell in that window, regardless of how old the PR itself was.

        Query params: since, until (ISO 8601, compared against merged_at),
        repo (optional, exact match).

        Reports two distinct timing metrics, since they answer different
        questions:
        - open-to-merge: full PR lifecycle (create to merge). Skewed by
          PRs that sat stale for a long time before anyone reviewed them.
        - approval-to-merge: first APPROVED review to merge -- "how long
          did it take to land once approved," not muddied by staleness.
          None/excluded for PRs merged without a formal approval (e.g. an
          admin override).

        Also reports avg_retest_count (e2e runs beyond the first, per PR
        -- see _count_e2e_retests).

        Both timing metrics report mean AND median -- a handful of PRs
        approved and then simply never merged for days/weeks (no new
        commits, no blocker, just forgotten) skew the mean heavily; median
        shows the typical case instead.

        Also reports queue-wait stats (entered merge queue -> merged) and
        approval-to-queue stats (first approval -> entered merge queue),
        split out from approval-to-merge for exactly the reason described
        in _upsert_pr_merge/_lookup_queued_at: since the merge queue
        rolled out, approval-to-merge silently includes label-gate and
        batch-wait time that has nothing to do with review speed.
        approval-to-queue is the part that's still a genuine human/process
        signal; queue-wait is the new structural cost. Both are None/"n/a"
        for a window with no merge-queue PRs at all (e.g. before rollout).
